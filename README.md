# banknote


Banknote is a simple personal finance tracking website. The data processing is based on a transactional processing model.

Things are still in development for this.


## Setup

Currently, a server with PHP is needed to use banknote.

## Unit Tests

The unit tests require PHPUnit. They can be ran by calling:
```
util/run-tests.sh```
